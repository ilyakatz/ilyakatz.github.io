#####  Why should you hire me?

* **Experience** - I've worked on various system from tiny open scripts to enterprise level system and everything in between
* **Results** - My emphasis on results means I'm ready to jump in to make it happen. I don't believe in cheap talk, it's about action. Every day is a Day of Action.
* **Enthusiasm** - When I accept a job or take on a project, it is not because I just wait for a paycheck to clear every 15 days (which is nice too) but it is because I believe in it and I want to contribute.
* **Education** - Learning is part of my nature. My most recent endevour in education is an [Android Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/android-001) class.
* **Openness** - My philosophy is that everyone wins when there is a room for open constructive critisim. I do not hold back my thoughts.
* **Work ethic** - Don't take my word for it, feel free to ask my [former](http://www.linkedin.com/in/juliankhandros) [colleagues](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyascharrenbroich), [managers](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikegrassotti), [classmates](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nnaoumov), [interns](https://github.com/jki127) and [collaborators](http://www.linkedin.com/in/grinkot). You can also ask my [brother](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gennadiy-katz/3/984/94), but he may be a little biased.
* **Decency** - I'm not a robot, neither are you. We all want to work with nice people. What I'm trying to say "I'm a nice guy to work with".

#####  Why should you stop reading this and move to the next profile?

I am not a "Ruby Rockstar" or a "JavaScript Ninja"[[1]](#footnotes).

* Over the years I have work with a variety of [technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katzil) used in different industries. I don't know anyone who is an expert in so many fields. If you know someone who is great in all of them, you should hire him/her.

##### Why is this site so plain?

I concentrate on getting things done. My profile is no exception...tbd

##### Where is proof?

You have every right to believe that everything I say is made up. Here are some links to my activity on the web that will give some legitimacy to my words.
